/**
 * Drop-in trait for `Laravel\Mcp\Server\Server` subclasses. Registers six
 * JSON-RPC method handlers when the host server runs:
 *
 *   - `tools/list` → `X402ListTools` — advertises priced tools as
 *     `_meta["x402/price"]` so agents can discover prices before invoking.
 *   - `tools/call` → `X402CallTool` — gates any tool annotated with
 *     `#[X402Price]` behind a verified + settled x402 payment. Tools
 *     without `#[X402Price]` pass through to the standard `CallTool`.
 *   - `resources/list` → `X402ListResources` — advertises priced
 *     resources as `_meta["x402/price"]`. Templates are filtered by the
 *     parent `ServerContext::resources()` and listed elsewhere.
 *   - `resources/read` → `X402ReadResource` — gates any `Resource`
 *     annotated with `#[X402Price]`. The resource's URI is used as the
 *     challenge resource verbatim. Free resources pass through.
 *   - `prompts/list` → `X402ListPrompts` — advertises priced prompts
 *     as `_meta["x402/price"]`.
 *   - `prompts/get` → `X402GetPrompt` — gates any `Prompt` annotated
 *     with `#[X402Price]`. Synthesises `mcp://prompt/{name}` for the
 *     challenge resource. Free prompts pass through.
 *
 * **Override-resilient by design.** PHP traits lose to subclass method
 * declarations, so a single hook point can be silently shadowed by a
 * downstream override. To keep payment gating from disappearing on a
 * custom `boot()`, `start()`, or both, the trait registers via two
 * independent entry points:
 *
 *   - `start()` — primary hook, runs once per server lifecycle.
 *   - `handle()` — safety net, runs once per JSON-RPC message. Catches
 *     subclasses that override `start()`. `addMethod()` is idempotent
 *     so the per-message cost is two array writes — well below noise.
 *
 * The only configuration that fully escapes the trait is a subclass that
 * overrides BOTH `start()` and `handle()` without calling `parent::*`.
 * That is an explicit, deep customization — not something a typical
 * `boot()` override would touch by accident.
 *
 * Users who *want* to opt out of trait defaults for a specific tool —
 * for example to register their own `tools/call` handler — should call
 * `addMethod()` from `boot()`; explicit registrations made there win
 * over the trait, because trait registration runs *before* `parent::start()`
 * (and `boot()` runs inside `parent::start()`).
